            <h2 class="section-title">About Ted Kuaie Alau</h2>
            <p><br>
Ted Kuaie Alau is an accomplished and highly respected professional
 from Jiwaka Province, Papua New Guinea, and is currently based in Port 
 Moresby. With forty years of experience in Higher Education Administration 
 and Human Resources Management, he has built a distinguished career 
 across Papua New Guinea’s leading universities and government institutions.
  His expertise spans academic registration, student affairs, strategic
   leadership, policy development, and scholarship administration. Throughout
    his career, he has remained committed to mentoring and supporting young people 
    as they progress through their academic and professional journeys.<br><br>

Mr. Alau’s professional experience reflects a steady rise through key
 administrative and leadership roles. From 2015 to 2022, he served as the
  Vice President for Student Affairs at Divine Word University, where he 
  provided executive leadership to the Student Services Office and ensured 
  that students received high-quality support and welfare services. Prior to 
  this, between 2007 and 2015, he served as the Executive Officer for Student 
  Services at the same institution, managing operations and providing administrative 
  support to the University President.<br><br>

From 2001 to 2006, Mr. Alau served as Deputy Secretary at the Department of
 Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (DHERST). In this role,
  he was responsible for managing and administering the Tertiary Education 
  Student Assistance Scheme (TESAS), a national scholarship program that directly 
  impacted thousands of students across the country. Earlier in his career, between 
  1989 and 2000, he served as Deputy Registrar at the University of Goroka, where 
  he provided leadership and oversight for critical Registrar’s Office functions. 
  His earlier roles at the University of Goroka included serving as Senior Assistant 
  Registrar from 1987 to 1989, and Assistant Registrar from 1980 to 1986, where he 
  built foundational expertise in university administration and student support 
  services. His career began in 1978 as a Graduate Assistant at the Registrar’s 
  Office of the University of Papua New Guinea, where he supported key administrative 
  functions immediately after graduation.<br><br>

Mr. Alau’s academic background is equally impressive. He holds a Master of Arts
 in Development Studies and Human Resources from the Australian National University
  in Canberra, awarded under his second Australian Government scholarship, which he 
  completed in 1998. He also earned a Master of Education from the University of New 
  England, Australia, through his first Australian Government scholarship in 1986.
   His foundational qualification is a Bachelor of Education from the University of 
   Papua New Guinea, where he graduated in 1977 after matriculating in 1974. His
    education reflects a lifelong commitment to learning, leadership, and service 
    in the field of higher education.<br><br>

Beyond his professional career, Mr. Alau is a passionate sports enthusiast. 
He enjoys watching football and is a devoted supporter of the Brisbane Broncos.
 His dedication to sports mirrors his commitment to excellence, teamwork, and 
 personal development—qualities that have defined his remarkable career.
