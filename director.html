            <h2 class="section-title">From Humble Beginnings to Educating PNG</h2>
            <p>My story is that God raised me, a simple man from the village, to give me a great responsibility, because my heart is right. I failed my Grade Six (6) in the 1970s and returned to my village for five years. I felt hopeless, but thank God, He led the missionary of Evangelical Brotherhood Church (EBC) to start a Sunday school in my village. I converted and became a Christian.</p>
            <p>The church pastors of EBC appointed me to be a Bible Verse teacher, then they promoted me to become a Sunday school teacher for five (5) years.</p>
            <p>Then I was selected to attend a Village Bible School set up by the Church (EBC). The church sent me to different schools until I came to the University of Papua New Guinea in 1991.</p>
            <p>During the practical project to collect marks towards my degree, I was assigned to set up a preschool so I could teach little children songs and Bible verses, as I have taught in my Sunday School.</p>
            <p>There in 1993, the seed for what is to become the Waigani Christian College was planted. I started in a small Kunai Round Haus classroom, with only 13 students, thirteen kina (K13.00) pocket allowance, and a bicycle to begin the school.</p>
            <p>In 1994, I graduated from the University of Papua New Guinea and went on to become the first Principal of my small Waigani Christian Preschool.</p>
            <p>In 2007, I ventured into politics and became the Member of Parliament for North Waghi for the first time (2007 to 2012). I was out of Parliament for the following two terms (2012–2017, 2017–2022) but was re-elected in the last 2022 National General Elections as the member for North Waghi, for the second term.</p>
            <h3>Word from the Director</h3>
            <p>The 30th anniversary of Waigani Christian College (WCC) marks an achievement and a milestone, as I reflect back to when I first started (1993). It was just a practical assessment project for my course at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG). I did it just to get marks to pass my course and graduate. I never would have dreamt or imagined what it would turn out to be, thirty (30) years down the line.</p>
            <p>It is the journey that God has set before me, and inspired me to follow, so I could serve the people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
            <p>WCC is now a reputable educational institution and a “School of Second Chance”, as declared by current Prime Minister, Honourable James Marape in 2014. During his visit (2014), Hon. James Marape was the Education Minister who purposefully came to initiate the Standard Based Education (SBE) program, and chose WCC to pilot the Standard Based Curriculum (SBC). At that time, James Marape labeled WCC as a “School of Second Chance”, to acknowledge our school’s contribution to the rejects (students) of other schools, and providing them another opportunity for education.</p>
            <p>WCC started from a humble beginning and has grown into what it is today — a fully-fledged private school, offering education to children from all age groups — from Early Childhood Learning to Primary and Secondary School level.</p>
            <p>We have matured into an education institution that has the ambition to grow further than just the Primary and Secondary Level education. As we celebrate our 30th anniversary, it is fitting that WCC develops further into a tertiary institution. We aspire to establish a University for Diploma and Degree programs, and a Teachers College for Early Childhood and Degree teachers.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned, I started off without having the vision of establishing a school like what WCC is today. But after providing education services for 30 years, I believe it is the right time to bring WCC to the next level in its journey — to reach the next step.</p>
            <p>I have learnt to set benchmarks and work towards achieving them for my school. Therefore, my next objective is to elevate to a Tertiary Institution. I know that I am not a man of dreams and visions, but I believe that I am blessed to create dreams and visions for others through what I do.</p>
