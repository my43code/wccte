            <p><br>
Ms. Paru Eo is a highly respected professional in Early Childhood Education,

   development of high-quality early childhood programs. Her career reflects 
   a deep commitment to nurturing young learners and advancing educational
    excellence nationwide. She has developed expertise in curriculum implementation, 
    standards-based curriculum design, and assessment practices, making her a valuable

Throughout her career, Ms. Eo has demonstrated steady advancement from 
classroom teaching to senior leadership and academic roles. She currently

  extensively in trainer and senior trainer roles in Abau District, Central Province,
   where she provided vital teacher training and professional development. 
   Her earlier years were spent in the classroom as a Senior Teacher and Assistant 
   Teacher, building the strong practical teaching foundation that continues 
   to guide her work today.<br><br>

Beyond her formal positions, Ms. Eo has played important roles in educational 
leadership, policy development, and teacher capacity-building. She served as a 
member of the Elementary Subject Advisory Committee under the Curriculum

development. She has facilitated major workshops, including the School Learning
 Improvement Plan (SLIP), Teacher In-service Plan programs, and Board of Management
  training sessions. She has participated in key training programs related to the
   Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Harassment (PSEH), Standards-Based
    Curriculum implementation, and basic computing, further strengthening her 
    ability to serve educators and institutions.<br><br>
